Dooify was a platform for exchanging services using time as a currency. We were featured in newspapers and local TV in Stockholm, Sweden. In the end it didn't take off, but the experience prepared me for taking on greater responsibilities.

## IT Consultant

### Purecontent 2011 ![Purecontent](logos/purecontent.png)

I worked together with Richard to take their process of content manufacturing and delivery and make a tool to streamline it and increase efficiency.

> I have been so impressed with Mika's work for Purecontent. The system I wanted was in my head and on various pieces of paper or graphical sketches. Mika took those and interpreted them well, offering suggestions for shortcuts, improvements or extra features that could be incorporated for little extra effort. When he didn't know something, he told me, then he went off and learned about it in his own time and came back to put it into practice. Great work and we'd welcome you back for more when we're ready.
