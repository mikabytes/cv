# Experience

## PCB design, Solutions Architect, App development

### My actual house 2020 to Present

Designed and implemented a solution for Home Automation & Building Management System while my house was constructed. While I’m also the employer here, it’s worth noting as I accumulated great experience.

- PCB design, manufacturing in China for import
- Automatic failover, native Data Center, based on Kubernetes + Ceph
- MetalLB routing
- Control of each room lights, ventilation, outlets, heating, and humidity
- App to control every aspect from anywhere in the world
- Schemas to control each aspect based on sunset/sunrise or timers
