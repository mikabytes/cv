## Senior Developer

### Pingdom 2014 - 2015 ![Pingdom](logos/pingdom.jpeg)

At Pingdom, I focused on software architecture and methodologies to ensure projects are held to a high level of quality, leveraging Agile, Test-Driven Development, and SOLID principles. I actively reviewed and improved overall design.

I played a key role in enhancing the core product algorithm, processing data from 300,000 deployments with 10-second updates. I implemented comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, ensuring confidence in maintaining the product during ongoing development.

## IT Consultant

### Purecontent 2013 ![Purecontent](logos/purecontent.png)

At Purecontent, I played a pivotal role in developing a web-based collaboration platform dedicated to optimizing the end-to-end process of content creation.

Tasked with creating a tool, I designed a solution that empowered contributors—writers, editors, project managers, and administrators—to seamlessly collaborate within a user-friendly and secure environment.

The implemented solution involved developing stand-alone and RESTful components in Ruby, complemented by a JavaScript front-end using ExtJs technology for a "Desktop-like" experience within a web browser.

As the sole creator, I assumed diverse roles, including customer relations, software architecture, development, database and server administration, design, and testing.

> I have been so impressed with Mika's work for Purecontent. The system I wanted was in my head and on various pieces of paper or graphical sketches. Mika took those and interpreted them well, offering suggestions for shortcuts, improvements or extra features that could be incorporated for little extra effort. When he didn't know something, he told me, then he went off and learned about it in his own time and came back to put it into practice. Great work and we'd welcome you back for more when we're ready.
